3. Enable the Video Intelligence API

Before you can begin using the Video Intelligence API, you must enable the API. You can enable the API by using the following command in the Cloud Shell:

gcloud services enable videointelligence.googleapis.com
Note: If this command ERRORs, check that the current Project ID matches your codelab Project ID.

Use the following command to find the current Project ID being used by Cloud Shell:

gcloud info | grep "project"

If the Project ID is not correct, use the following command to use the correct Project ID:

gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>

Replace <PROJECT_ID> with the correct Project ID.
