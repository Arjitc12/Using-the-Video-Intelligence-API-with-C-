Explicit Content Detection detects adult content within a video. Adult content is content generally appropriate for 18 years of age and older, including but not limited to nudity, sexual activities, and pornography (including cartoons or anime). The response includes a bucketized likelihood value, from VERY_UNLIKELY to VERY_LIKELY.

When Explicit Content Detection evaluates a video, it does so on a per-frame basis and considers visual content only. The audio component of the video is not used to evaluate the explicit content level.

To detect explicit content, navigate to the Program.cs file inside the VideoIntApiDemo folder and replace the code with the following:

using System;
using Google.Cloud.VideoIntelligence.V1;

namespace VideoIntApiDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var client = VideoIntelligenceServiceClient.Create();
            var request = new AnnotateVideoRequest
            {
                InputUri = "gs://cloudmleap/video/next/gbikes_dinosaur.mp4",
                Features = { Feature.ExplicitContentDetection }
            };
            var op = client.AnnotateVideo(request).PollUntilCompleted();
            foreach (var result in op.Result.AnnotationResults)
            {
                foreach (var frame in result.ExplicitAnnotation.Frames)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Time Offset: {0}", frame.TimeOffset);
                    Console.WriteLine("Pornography Likelihood: {0}", frame.PornographyLikelihood);
                    Console.WriteLine();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Take a minute or two to study the code and see how the explicit content detection was performed.

Back in Cloud Shell, run the app:

dotnet run
It might take several seconds but eventually, you should see the following output:

dotnet run

Time Offset: "0.056149s"
Pornography Likelihood: VeryUnlikely

Time Offset: "1.166841s"
Pornography Likelihood: VeryUnlikely
...
Time Offset: "41.678209s"
Pornography Likelihood: VeryUnlikely

Time Offset: "42.596413s"
Pornography Likelihood: VeryUnlikely
Summary
In this step, you were able to perform explicit content detection on a video using the Video Intelligence API. Read more about Explicit content detection.
