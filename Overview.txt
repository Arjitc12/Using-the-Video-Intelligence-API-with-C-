Overview

Google Cloud Video Intelligence API allows developers to use Google video analysis technology as part of their applications.

It can be used to do:

Label Detection: Detect objecs, such as dog, flower, human, in the video.
Explicit Content Detection: Detect adult content within a video.
Shot Change Detection: Detect scene changes within the video.
The REST API enables users to annotate videos stored locally or in Google Cloud Storage with contextual information at the level of the entire video, per segment, per shot, and per frame.

In this codelab, you will focus on using the Video Intelligence API with C#. You will learn how to analyze videos for labels, shot changes and explicit content detection.
