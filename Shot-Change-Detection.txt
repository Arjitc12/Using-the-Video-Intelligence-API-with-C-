You can use the Video Intelligence API to detect shot changes in a video stored locally or in Google Cloud Storage. In this section, you will perform video analysis for shot changes on a file located in Google Cloud Storage.

To detect shot changes, navigate to the Program.cs file inside the VideoIntApiDemo folder and replace the code with the following:

using System;
using Google.Cloud.VideoIntelligence.V1;

namespace VideoIntApiDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var client = VideoIntelligenceServiceClient.Create();
            var request = new AnnotateVideoRequest
            {
                InputUri = "gs://cloudmleap/video/next/gbikes_dinosaur.mp4",
                Features = { Feature.ShotChangeDetection }
            };
            var op = client.AnnotateVideo(request).PollUntilCompleted();
            foreach (var result in op.Result.AnnotationResults)
            {
                foreach (var annotation in result.ShotAnnotations)
                {
                    Console.Out.WriteLine("Start Time Offset: {0}\tEnd Time Offset: {1}",
                        annotation.StartTimeOffset, annotation.EndTimeOffset);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Take a minute or two to study the code and see how the shot detection is performed.

Back in Cloud Shell, run the app. You should see the following output:

dotnet run
You should see the following output:

Start Time Offset: "0s" End Time Offset: "5.166666s"
Start Time Offset: "5.233333s"  End Time Offset: "10.066666s"
Start Time Offset: "10.100s"    End Time Offset: "28.133333s"
Start Time Offset: "28.166666s" End Time Offset: "42.766666s"
Summary
In this step, you were able to use the Video Intelligence API to detect shot changes in a file stored in Google Cloud Storage. Read more about Shot changes.
