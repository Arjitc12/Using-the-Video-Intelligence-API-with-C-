Label analysis detects labels in a video either stored locally or in Google Cloud Storage. In this section, you will analyze a video for labels stored in Google Cloud Storage.

Note: We are using a pre-recorded video stored on Google Cloud Storage: gs://cloudmleap/video/next/gbikes_dinosaur.mp4. You can view the video before sending it to the Video Intelligence API here.

First, open the code editor from the top right side of the Cloud Shell:



Navigate to the Program.cs file inside the VideoIntApiDemo folder and replace the code with the following:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Google.Cloud.VideoIntelligence.V1;

namespace VideoIntApiDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var client = VideoIntelligenceServiceClient.Create();
            var request = new AnnotateVideoRequest
            {
                InputUri = "gs://cloudmleap/video/next/gbikes_dinosaur.mp4",
                Features = { Feature.LabelDetection }
            };
            var op = client.AnnotateVideo(request).PollUntilCompleted();
            foreach (var result in op.Result.AnnotationResults)
            {
                PrintLabels("Video", result.SegmentLabelAnnotations);
                PrintLabels("Shot", result.ShotLabelAnnotations);
                PrintLabels("Frame", result.FrameLabelAnnotations);
            }
        }

        static void PrintLabels(string labelName,
            IEnumerable<LabelAnnotation> labelAnnotations)
        {
            foreach (var annotation in labelAnnotations)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{labelName} label: {annotation.Entity.Description}");
                foreach (var entity in annotation.CategoryEntities)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"{labelName} label category: {entity.Description}");
                }
                foreach (var segment in annotation.Segments)
                {
                    Console.Write("Segment location: ");
                    Console.Write(segment.Segment.StartTimeOffset);
                    Console.Write(":");
                    Console.WriteLine(segment.Segment.EndTimeOffset);
                    Console.WriteLine($"Confidence: {segment.Confidence}");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Take a minute or two to study the code and see how the video is being labelled.

Back in Cloud Shell, run the app:

dotnet run
It takes several seconds for Video Intelligence API to extract labels but eventually, you should see the following output:

Video label: bicycle
Video label category: vehicle
Segment location: "0s":"42.766666s"
Confidence: 0.475821
Video label: tyrannosaurus
Video label category: dinosaur
Segment location: "0s":"42.766666s"
Confidence: 0.4222222
Video label: tree
Video label category: plant
Segment location: "0s":"42.766666s"
Confidence: 0.4231415
...
Note: If this C# code does not work for you, verify the instructions you performed during Authenticate API requests step.

Using the following command to verify the value of GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable:

echo GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

It should output the value "~/key.json".

If it does, next check that a service account was created and is located at "~/key.json" by using:

cat "~/key.json"

You should see something similar to:

{

"type": "service_account",

"project_id": "PROJECT_ID",

"private_key_id": "ff31939192529e07f42e4535fb20bb029def1276",

"Private_key":...

If you don't, revisit the Authenticate API requests step.

Summary
In this step, you were able to list all the labels in a video using the Video Intelligence API. You can read more on Label detection page.
